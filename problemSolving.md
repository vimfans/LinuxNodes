1.Fixing things and bulding things is always a rewarding task.the more you problem
solve, the better more you will get too.

2.Right attitute

1).Be Open Minded
. the actual problem you have may be different to the problem you think you have.
. what you think is causing the problem may not actually be what is causing the problem.
. the best option may be to throw out your solution and start again in a different direction.
. your beliefs on anything and everthing could be wrong.

Always be open to different opinions. you should take the time to appreciate and understand
them. 

2).Be Inquisitive
3).Ask the Right Questions
. What is it actually doing?
. How is it actually doing it?
. How effectively is it performing its purpose?
. Why is it doing it/ What would happen if it was taken out?
. What is it's relationship with other components?
. What could i do to test that assumption?

4).Slow Down
Slowing down can be difficult to do but can make a big difference.
Another approach to help slow things down is to come back to a problem.Leave it for a day or two(or an hour or two) and come back to it. You'll be surprised how much of a difference it can make.

5).Don't be Lazy
Effective problem solving is more like piecing together a jigsaw puzzle.We first look
at all the pieces,trying to find the ones that stand out. Then we attack the problem from
there and as the picure builds, the easier it gets. it's more work but the outcome is
always much better.

6).Don't be Panic
Panic is the initial reaction to many when faced with a problem.The seasoned problem solver
however is calm and relaxed in the face of problems as they know that solutions always exist
and with the right approach they will triumph.
When you are calm you are able to think clearer and more creatively.



3.Make sure You are Solving the Right Problem
Sometimes the problem you initially see is not the problem at all. it is a symptom of 
the actual problem. if you solve the symptom you aren't solving the real problem,you are
just putting a band-aid on it.

4.The Process

1).Assess the situation
if you are fixing a problem, then you need to find as much information as possible to help
you work out what has gone wrong and why. Read any error messages carefully. if there is 
any output, look over it to see if there are any useful clues.

if you are creating something then you should consider what resources you have available
to build with. Consider all resources, even if can't see how they would be useful. Sometimes
with a bit of creativity you can find great uses for seemingly unneeded resources.

Sometimes we may need to do some testing to help assess the situation.
. if i change the input do i get similar error messages or output?
. Are there other things i could do which wil give me other information to compare the output
against to better understand it ?
. Can i break my solution down into several steps and verify that each step is behaving as 
intended?

2).Create a hypothesis
it is a good idea to start at the very bottom, with the most obvious culprits, and work your
way up.

3).Test your hypothesis
