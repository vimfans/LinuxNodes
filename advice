1.The only other thing, is the shell is linux's "command line interpreter", and it's also a scripting language (like batch files)... and, it's very powerful,
 and controls your linux and tells it what you want to do... so, it's good to get as much detail about the shell you use
 (there are a small handful of shells you can use, by default, you have the shell called bash)... so,
 do a shell tutorial, and learn as many of the details as you can


2. Reading reference-level material is a skill that you can get or improve through practice... in linux and unix, the reference stuff is in the man pages... so, 
I'd suggest to read at least one man page every day, to at least discover the common structures of them

3.Reading software source code

4.Complete your documents before next step

5.Poorly written source code teaches you to write good soruce code.aceept criticism but don't criticize

6.Testing to be fllowed like a religion

7.Celebrate every bug you find:
  1) Bugs are your enemies, so you have killed one.
  2) Now your software is having one bug less.
  3) Mistakes are good as long as they are not repeating.
  4) What you learn today, prepares you for tomorrow.

8. Leave the ego behind, be eager to learn.
